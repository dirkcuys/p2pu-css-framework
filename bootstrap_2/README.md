# P2PU CSS Framework

The p2pu starts with a clone of https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap and adds customizations to make bootstrap in p2pu style.

The idea is to just use the well known bootstrap framework and documentation and automatically get a p2pu styled web site.

## Exploring Styles and reading documentation

* the included documentation reflects the customized styles
* open doc/index.html in your browser of choice to explore

## Installing to customize 

* clone the repo
* ensure that ruby 1.9.x is installed
* `bundle install`
* customize the css to your liking
* `rake`

## Using in your project

* Simply copy the assets to their proper places in your project. This means all of the fllowing files:
    * bootstrap*.css
    * js/*.js
    * img/*.png
